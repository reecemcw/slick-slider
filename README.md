# slick-slider
A straight-forward slideshow built on the Slick CSS framework.

Better used for touch-screen devices but also functional with cursor drag.

Example is for a company leadership slideshow detailing their image, name and quote attributed to them.
Scalable to make each media piece an <a href="#"> element.
